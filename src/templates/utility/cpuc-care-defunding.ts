			    <li> In January 2025, CPUC President Alice Reynolds and California Department of Technology Director Liana Bailey-Crimmins submitted a letter to Californiaâ€™s Congressional Delegation urging Congress to approve additional funding for the CARE / FERA programs. Unfortunately, the request has been denied. With no additional funding, the CARE / FERA programs will no longer be applicable for new and existing households. Those houses relying on this assistance can apply to other incentive and assistance programs, like the Energy Stabilization Program for green energy or the LIHEAP initiative</li>
