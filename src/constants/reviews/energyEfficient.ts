  "I wasn’t sure what to expect from {{companyName}}, but I’m glad I gave them a chance. They didn’t do any upgrades to my home, but the bill reduction alone has made a noticeable difference. It’s nice not to dread opening the utility bill every month",

  "It's been 7 years since I've installed the panels with them. Everything works great! The amount of money I saved is probably in the tens of thousands now with Edison increasing their pricing",

  "The {{companyName}} program is outstanding! Not only did they reduce my electric bill significantly, but they also upgraded our main panel and installed a new heating and AC system. The whole experience felt seamless, and the team took the time to explain every step. I feel like I’m saving money while also doing something good for the environment",

  "We didn’t qualify for any home upgrades, but {{companyName}} still lowered our energy bill. It’s not a huge savings, but it’s enough to make a difference over time. The process was quick and easy, and I appreciated how upfront they were about what we’d get",

  "As others have pointed out, we were hesitant at first. However our experience with {{companyName}} has been fantastic. The process was smooth, and their team walked us through everything. We've saved almost $1,200 per year since we started about 2 years ago, and the reliability of the system is a game changer. We're so glad we left Edison!!",

  "My wife and I qualified for {{companyName}} because we're retired and living on a limited income. They reduced my electric bill and upgraded my home with attic insulation and a new cool roof. The savings are a huge relief, and I appreciate that they back everything with long-term warranties. The production guarantee they offer made me feel confident in making the switch",

  "I can’t believe how much {{companyName}} has helped us. Our utility bills were eating up so much of our budget, but now they’re manageable. Plus, we got double-pane windows and a cool roof out of the deal. The workers were polite and cleaned up after themselves, too. As close to a win-win situation as it gets, all thanks to the different programs available to us",

  "I can’t believe we didn’t do this sooner. {{companyName}} took care of everything and replaced our sky-high electric bills with something much better. If you qualify, I wouldn't hesitate to make the switch. I read every line of their agreement before moving forward, but only after taking the plunge I can confidently say they are the real deal",

  "The savings alone make it worth it, but what really impressed me was {{companyName}}’s guarantee of output and the consistency of the system. It’s been a year now, and everything has worked exactly as promised. Fantastic company!",

  "From start to finish, {{companyName}} made the transition easy and worry-free. The savings are undeniable, and I love knowing that our system is built to last with their excellent warranties. We couldn’t be happier.",

  "I had my doubts going into this, especially since we’d been burned by another company in the past. But {{companyName}} was different. They were clear, honest, and didn’t try to oversell us. We didn’t get every upgrade, but even just the reduction in monthly costs has made a big difference. Definitely worth looking into.",

  "We’ve had our system for about three years now, and it’s been nothing but solid. The savings have been steady, and we haven’t had to deal with a single issue. I especially appreciated how they walked us through the whole process in plain language—no sales jargon, just facts.",

  "Our experience with {{companyName}} has been surprisingly smooth. I say 'surprisingly' because I usually expect hiccups with anything home-related, but they were on top of every detail. We ended up with upgraded insulation and a new AC unit, and our monthly energy costs dropped right away.",

  "At first, I was skeptical about how much we’d actually save, but now I’m a believer. We didn’t qualify for major upgrades, but even just the lower bill has freed up money for other things. The process was quick, and they never pressured us into anything.",

  "We’re about six months in, and I can already see the savings stacking up. {{companyName}} upgraded our panel and added attic insulation, which has made the house more comfortable too. Their staff was professional and respectful of our time. So far, no regrets!",

  "I wasn’t expecting much, but the results speak for themselves. Our electricity costs have gone down, and the whole experience was stress-free. {{companyName}} made sure we understood every step, and their follow-up has been excellent.",

  "We live in an older home, so I was surprised we qualified for as many upgrades as we did. {{companyName}} replaced our roof and improved the HVAC system, and our electric bills are now half what they used to be. Can’t recommend them enough.",

  "This was hands down one of the better decisions we’ve made for our home. The install team was courteous, the project stayed on schedule, and our energy bills are now much more manageable. I appreciated how transparent {{companyName}} was throughout the process.",

  "We’ve seen savings each month since switching over. Nothing earth-shattering, but over the course of a year it really adds up. The system has been reliable, and I like knowing we’re doing something better for the environment, too.",

  "{{companyName}} exceeded our expectations. We got energy-efficient windows and a modern HVAC upgrade through their program, and the comfort level in our home has noticeably improved. The monthly savings don’t hurt either. They really do deliver on what they promise.",

  "We got three quotes, and {{companyName}} stood out immediately. They weren’t the cheapest, but they explained every step and didn’t cut corners. Worth every penny. Great communication throughout.",

  "{{companyName}} transformed our outdated home into an energy-efficient space. The team was friendly and worked hard every single day.

  "After comparing quotes from four different contractors, I chose {{companyName}} because of how thorough their assessment was. They found issues others missed. Their attention to detail blew me away. Finished the project right on time, too. They even handled all the permit stuff, which saved me a big headache. My home is now more comfortable and looks better than ever.",

  "I was nervous about doing a big renovation, but {{companyName}} made it painless. The workers were kind and respectful of our space, even covered furniture and floors. The project manager kept us informed daily. I’ve already referred two neighbors! The whole process was extremely smooth. We felt like we were always in the loop. From start to finish, they exceeded our expectations in every way.",

  "The team at {{companyName}} was incredibly respectful. My kids were home during most of the work and they always kept noise to a minimum and cleaned up very well. Huge thanks!",

  "I’ve had bad experiences with contractors before, but {{companyName}} restored my faith. Courteous crew, top-notch materials, and stayed on budget. Couldn’t be happier with the outcome! We did attic insulation and HVAC upgrades and the results have been amazing. Even our home energy score improved. Honestly feels like a brand new home now.",

The crew showed up exactly when they said they would and worked straight through, no delays or excuses. Love that they respected our time.",

  "Hired them for new windows and insulation. Great pricing, clean work, no mess left behind. Would use again in a heartbeat. It’s hard to find a company that does solid work and still treats you like a priority. They did both.",

  "What impressed me most was how tidy they were. Each day they cleaned up the site like it was the last. Even my neighbors commented on how professional they were. I’ve had contractors leave a mess before — not this team. They respected my home like it was their own. Big fan of that level of care.",

  "Excellent service and amazing team! The crew worked long hours but never cut corners. They really care about doing it right. 5 stars! From the start, it was clear that quality mattered to them. Every nail, every seal was double-checked. They didn’t just finish the job — they made sure it was perfect.",

  "Honestly, didn’t expect this level of detail. Everything was so well planned and communicated. Even when a shipment delay happened, they kept us updated. Super transaprent and easy to work with. The project manager even stopped by on a Sunday to check a small issue we noticed. They just go above and beyond. Can’t recommend them enough.",

The workers showed up early, stayed late, and were polite the whole time. Our electric bill already dropped by 30%! Couldn’t believe it. Cleanest work site I’ve ever seen — they even vacuumed. 10 out of 10 would hire again.",

  "To be honest, I thought this was going to be a hassle, but {{companyName}} made everything incredibly easy. From the initial consultation to installation, they handled it all. We didn’t get every upgrade, but the utility bill savings alone are real. I tell everyone in my neighborhood to check if they qualify—it’s a no-brainer if you do.",

  "We were one of the last on our block to join the program, and I wish we had done it sooner. {{companyName}} not only helped lower our monthly energy costs, but they also upgraded our water heater at no extra charge. They’re clearly pros at what they do, and the whole experience felt tailored to our needs.",

  "I’ve dealt with plenty of home service companies over the years, but {{companyName}} stands out. Everything was upfront, and there were no hidden fees or fine-print surprises. Our attic insulation was upgraded, and our cooling bill dropped significantly—especially during the hot months. It's one of those rare cases where everything actually works as promised.",

  "We almost skipped the program because it sounded too good to be true. But after speaking with a rep and seeing real data, we moved forward. Thank goodness we did! {{companyName}} installed energy-efficient windows and got us out from under Edison's steep rates. The difference in comfort and cost is night and day.",

  "Our budget has always been tight, and every dollar counts. When {{companyName}} showed us how much we could save—without paying upfront—we decided to go for it. Now, our bill is almost cut in half, and the house stays cooler even without running the AC all day. Honestly, we finally feel like we’re not throwing money away every month.",

  "We’re coming up on the one-year mark since switching to {{companyName}}, and I’m still impressed. The team was on-time, respectful, and got us qualified for a main panel upgrade and wall insulation. The results? Lower bills and a quieter, more comfortable home. Wish more companies operated like this.",

  "If you’re on the fence, don’t wait too long—some of the programs fill up fast. That’s what happened to our neighbor, and they missed out. Luckily, we got in just in time. {{companyName}} upgraded our HVAC and helped us cut energy use by nearly 40%. They delivered on every promise.",

  "What sold me wasn’t just the savings—it was how transparent {{companyName}} was from the first call. No pressure, no gimmicks. They walked me through the whole thing, showed me past client results, and made it easy to decide. Now I’m saving hundreds a year and finally feel in control of my energy bills.",

  "After years of rising energy costs, we felt stuck. {{companyName}} showed us options we didn’t even know existed. We got double-pane windows and a cool roof, which have made a real impact. Plus, their follow-up support has been excellent—real people, not robots. Highly recommend checking them out.",

  "I almost ignored the mailer from {{companyName}}, but I’m so glad I called. They assessed our home, handled all the paperwork, and got us approved for several energy efficiency upgrades. Best part? We’re saving money *and* added value to the house. It’s rare you get both at once these days.",
